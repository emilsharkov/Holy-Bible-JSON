# Holy-Bible-JSON

## About
This is a compilation of the Holy Bible in 100+ languages and 800+ version in JSON format. This project's data is sourced from [Beblia](https://github.com/Beblia/Holy-Bible-XML-Format) with the exclusion of some Bibles because they presented problems while parsing. Please feel free to use this data, as it is not mine nor yours but God's. 

## Disclaimer
Please double check this data with the real thing before using it for important work. This data has been first parsed from another data source then again reparsed by me. This could cause there to be mistakes so please use this with caution.
